            <h2>7.10 - The Beginning</h2>
            <p>It all started on 7.10, a day that marked the beginning of a challenging journey. The preparations for the first entry were intense, filled with anticipation and uncertainty.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The First Entry</h2>
            <p>The first entry was a critical moment. It was a mixture of adrenaline, focus, and the unknown. We moved forward with the mission, knowing that this was just the beginning.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Confrontation and Injury</h2>
            <p>During the first entry, we faced a sudden confrontation. The situation escalated quickly, leading to my injury. The pain was immediate, but the mission had to continue.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Return</h2>
            <p>After the injury, I returned to regroup. It was a time for reflection, healing, and preparing for what was to come. The second entry loomed on the horizon, and I knew I had to be ready.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Second Entry</h2>
            <p>The second entry was even more intense. We were more prepared, but the stakes were higher. Every move was calculated, and every decision carried weight.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Third and Final Entry</h2>
            <p>The third and final entry marked the culmination of this journey. It was the last push, the final hurdle. The challenges were immense, but so was the determination to succeed.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Transition to Product Management</h2>
            <p>After the last entry, I knew it was time for a new chapter. The transition to product management was a natural progression. It allowed me to take the skills and experiences I had gained and apply them in a new, challenging environment.</p>
